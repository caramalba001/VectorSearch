# Vector Search for Person indentification method
This project establishes a robust customer identification system to accurately recognize individuals despite the absence of unique identifiers and common name misspellings. Utilizing PySpark, the raw customer data is transformed and cleaned, ensuring consistency. A multilingual transformer model generates vector embeddings for each name, capturing semantic similarities. Azure Data Factory orchestrates the seamless transfer of this enriched data to Azure Cosmos DB, facilitating scalable storage and efficient vector-based searches. To enhance accuracy, the system employs Levenshtein distance and romanization techniques, addressing character-level discrepancies and transliteration variations. Finally, comprehensive scoring rules classify records, distinguishing between the same person, uncertain matches, and different individuals, thereby improving overall data integrity and customer analysis.
